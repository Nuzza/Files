# Files
Files is a files manager built in python using the new PyGUI library. Upon completion, it will feature the following functionality:
- Navigation through most directories (some may require permission to access, while I do plan to solve this issue, it will not be a top priority).
- Navigation UI such as Back button, Forward button, Up directory button, Address bar, and Search bar.
- Fully functional search
- Refresh button to refresh the page.
- The ability to create files and folders.
- Sidebar with favourites support (currently limited to Home, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, and Videos. More customisation will come in a future update)
- Cut, Copy, Paste, Rename, Share, and Delete support
- Dynamic UI (meaning that the UI adapts to the size of the window as best as possible
- Context menu for more options (currently not implemented)
- Settings to change the appearance and performance.

Since the last update, Files has been completely redesigned using the new PyGUI library which brings new visuals and features to Files, have a look at the comparison image below:
